## Overview and Origin

A company named Riskalyze is on a mission to empower the world to invest fearlessly. Investing feels broken for the average investor, and subjective risk semantics like "aggressive" and "moderately conservative" don't help. We believe that when advisors align the world's investments with each investor's Risk Number®, anyone can invest fearlessly.

Riskalyze is transforming the advisory industry by empowering investment advisors to capture a quantitative measurement of client risk tolerance, and use that data to win new clients, capture and meet expectations and quantify suitability.

Business Idea 
Riskalyze started with a simple idea: the way advisors measure client risk tolerance and select allocations are broken. Just a few years removed from the Great Recession and Financial crisis, portfolio risk was very much at the forefront of investor’s minds. In addition to the importance of portfolio diversification, it is important investors take enough risk to meet mid and long-term investing goals. The founders saw traditional, qualitative risk assessment tools as inadequate and clunky. With the help of leading academic research, the Risk Number® was born. This new financial data point is a 1-99 risk rating shown to clients in an easy to read format similar to speed limit signs. As you’ll soon learn, this was just the beginning for Riskalyze.

## Business Activities:

What problem is Riskalyze trying to solve?
This has certainly evolved as the company moves up the Wealthtech hierarchy. The first problem the founders recognized as the traditional measurement of risk. The majority of advisors want to give their clients the right amount of risk but it wasn't easy for two reasons: advisors could not pinpoint how much risk a client actually wants to take and on the other hand advisors did not have a way to calculate the exact risk a portfolio has. Riskalyze brought solutions to those two problems together and allowed advisors to engineer risks to fit their clients. 

With the use of Risk Number® advisors are able to accomplish two very important objectives: obtain new clients and document their due diligence. Riskalyze has really made a name for themselves by equipping advisors with client-facing sales literature that translates into a very compelling sales pitch: I can measure your personal risk tolerance with a number and offer a custom-built portfolio that matches that exact number. While this might seem simple, until Riskalyze the words Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive were how advisors would describe their clients and the portfolios selected.

On the objective of advisor due diligence, Riskalyze hit a homerun. Never in the history of financial services has there been more emphasis on suitability. The Obama administration first proposed a fiduciary rule to protect retirement savers from conflicted advice back in 2010 and the rule is still being finalized ten years later. Seeing the writing on the wall, most advisors and their broker-dealer firms adopted customer suitability procedures in and out of retirement accounts. Finally, in December of 2019, the SEC finalized Reg Best Interest (BI) which cemented the required due diligence an advisor is required to provide. 

Riskalyze is often cited as the easiest way to sell risk tolerance capabilities and suitability to a client through their simple Risk Number® and client-facing technologies. In fact, if you Google “Reg BI” you might just see them advertising on the top line. 

Since their founding and success with Risk Number®, Riskalyze has continued to grow and innovate to become a disrupter within the WealthTech space. Today the company is focused on becoming the central digital hub for an advisor’s day to day client work. Now that they are integrated and essential to many advisors they have begun enhancing their risk offerings but also venturing into research, analytics, trading, and model portfolios. 

The company now provides three types of product and services :

Risk Alignment Platform | Automated Asset Management | Compliance Analytics 
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Analyze Portfolio Risk, Setting portfolio return expectations, stress testing, prospect comparisons, and Retirement Mapping | Autopilot, Risk Number, Account opening with e-signing, automated portfolio management, client self-service | Find accounts with bad investments or compliance issues, matching of objectives, automated case management workflow

The company’s focus on the model portfolios segment through its Automated Asset Management deserves some attention. Industry experts believe the bulk of the company's Series A funding of $20M went towards the build-out of its own turnkey asset management platform (TAMP). Their investment models are based around risk scoring, a partner store where advisors can access strategies and research from asset managers, and a next-generation Autopilot that advisors can use to build portfolios, assign them to client accounts, automatically generate trades across multiple custodians and rebalance existing portfolios. The introduction of these products moved Riskalyze from just a portfolio risk management technology to also a B2B Robo provider. 

Intended Customer 
Riskalyze’s intended customer consists of RIAs, hybrid advisors, independent broker-dealers, RIA networks, custodians, clearing firms, and asset managers.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are currently 210,190 personal financial advisors working in the United States. But there is no reason for Riskalyze to contain themselves to just the USA and in fact, they are currently doing business in Canada and Australia. The Boston Consulting Group estimated there was $74.3 trillion of global assets under management (AUM) for the year 2018. As long as that amount continues to grow, private wealth management and financial advisory services will grow right along with it.

Competitive Advantage 
The number one advantage Riskalyze has in the marketplace is Risk Number®. As we have discussed this innovative way of measuring client risk tolerance and portfolio risk with an easy-to-understand output is a major differentiator. This was the first quantitative system to help advisors identify a client’s risk tolerance. 

Another advantage is powerful integrations with all the major CRM, custodian, and portfolio management software and Reg BI Compliance procedures. And while still a newer offering, the company's Autopilot 2.0 is gaining attention as “the first automated account platform.”

But one of the most mentioned advantages is Riskalyze Academy. Implementing the Risk Number® into an advisor’s business is not as easy as putting a new app on your phone. You’re talking about weaving a whole bunch of concepts about risk into client engagements, client interactions, and client meetings. That’s a lot of work. It takes support and coaching for an advisor to get there. So, we invested in having the industry’s best support team. We consistently hear from advisors that we have 95% plus customer satisfaction ratings with our support team. 

Technologies 
Riskalyze uses 31 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack. Riskalyze is actively using 44 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include Google Font API, LetsEncrypt, and Font Awesome.

Additionally, they use Ruby, Modernizer, Typescript, and Cloudflare, according to Stackshare.

## Landscape

Domain: WealthTech
Riskalyze sits squarely in the WealthTech domain of FinTech. The WealthTech domain is ever-changing and experiencing tremendous growth. In 2019, the size of the Wealthtech market, measured by the segment’s assets under management, was $1.5 trillion. PitchBook expects the asset base to grow to over $6 trillion by 2023, representing a compound annual growth rate of 42.3%. By the end of 2020, the wealth management industry is projected to spend the US $21.4 billion on tech, and the figure is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% year-over-year (YoY) until 2023. 

Trends
WealthTech companies capitalize on inefficiencies in financial services and wealth management. The constant change and adapting of the industry provide a fertile ground for technology. Over the last 5-10 years major trends in the industry have been:

* Commoditization of portfolio management 
* A new generation of investors and their expectations of advice 
* Big data and advanced analytics 
* The movement towards more holistic advice 
* A growing number of advisors moving to an independent model 
* The rising cost of increasing regulatory burden, enforcement of Reg BI
* According to Deloitte The future of wealth in the United States

Competition 
WealthTech contains many sub-domains that consist of some of the major players in financial services such as LPL, TD Ameritrade, Blackrock, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity Investments. Riskalyze is working in two sub-domains Portfolio Risk Management and B2B Robos. Riskalyze is the major player in Portfolio Risk Management but a smaller player in B2B Robos. According to RIA In a Box, Riskalyze has a 59% market share of the risk tolerance software sector. Within Portfolio Risk Management their main competitors are Riskalyze Totum, Finametrica, Kwanti, Tolerisk, Eze Software, Novus, and Lifeyield. Within B2B Robos their main competitors are Envestnet, Legg Mason, Blackrock, Vestmark, Betterment, and TIAA. 

## Results:

There is no doubt, Riskalyze is a star within the WealthTech space. Their delivery of a risk assessment software was impeccably timed. They disrupted old, designed a new essential investing measurement, and showed their customers how to sell more of their services by using their number. As of August 2017, Riskalyze now supports 20,000 advisors representing $380 billion assets, and CEO Aaron Klein says the company has grown 74 times over the last three years. Riskalyze has been named Most Innovative Company by Fast Company for several years. Most importantly for the advisors, they work with they have earned a spot on their desktop.

Riskalyze is a private company and has not received any funding since 2016 so it is difficult to find revenue and sales date. Estimated annual revenue is $26.5M per year which equates to approximately $130,00 per employee.

As we have learned, Riskalyze continues to diversify its offerings and now plays in three sub-domains within WealthTech: Risk Alignment, Automated Asset Management, and Compliance. 

Core Metrics: Market Share 
One of the key measures of success for Riskalyze is the share of the market. As we have discussed, Riskalyze is playing in several different sub-domains. While they are dominant leaders in risk tolerance and stress testing, they are still working on automated portfolio management. 

Sub-domain | Rank | Market Share | Penetration 
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Risk Tolerance Instruments| 1 | 29.88% | 37.71% 
Economic Analysis and Stress Testing| 1 | 11.26% | 49.36%
Automated Portfolio Management| 7 | 1.13% | 25.78% 

All data as of February 2019 according to T3 Software Survey Report

Core Metrics: Advisor Adoption 
As with any new tool, the adoption of that tool is important. While Riskalyze has shown to be a leader in several sub-domains, the adoption of some of the tools they provide is still growing. Only 40% of financial advisors have adopted risk tolerance software. There are said to be over 200,000 financial advisors in the industry and as of June of 2018 Riskalyze works with over 20,000 financial advisors according to CEO Aaron Klien in an interview with Wharton.

Core Metrics: Customer Satisfaction 
An essential measure according to CEO Aaron Klein is customer satisfaction. This can also be important in retaining subscribers as well as word of mouth growth. The advisor community is small and connected and what's working for one advisor can quickly become a trend at a firm or community. Riskalyze is currently at 95% plus customer satisfaction ratings with their support team according to CEO Aaron Klien in an interview with Wharton.

Competitors 
Due to the diversified products offered by Riskalyze, they also compete against a wide variety of companies in the WealthTech space. Some of these competitors are micro-companies with a singular focus and some are tools provided by some of the largest wealth management firms. Within risk tolerance and stress testing Riskalyze is positioned well. Their products are typically more expensive, $350 a month versus $99 from most competitors, but off the charts advisor satisfaction shows they provide great value. Within the automated portfolio management space, they are competing against legacy players, and access to the platforms and models is advertised as free with fees coming from underlying asset management fees. Below are the top competitors in each space.  You will notice within each sub-domain Riskalyze does not have any repeat competitors. 

Risk Tolerance Instruments: FinaMetrica, RiXtrema, Pocket Risk, Tolerisk
Economic Analysis and Stress Testing: DFA Returns, FI 360, Morningstar, YCharts
Automated Portfolio Management: Envestnet, SEI, Schwab, LPL, Betterment
All data as of February 2019 according to T3 Software Survey Report

## Recommendations:

When I began this analysis of Riskalyze I was only aware of them as the creator of the Risk Number®. The most recent stop in my career required me to meet with financial advisors and sell mutual funds, ETFs, and portfolio advisory solutions. Starting in 2017 I began to hear about the company and I noticed a high level of satisfaction with their software. The concept was so simple yet so disruptive. Advisors started to ask me how an ETF would impact a client’s Risk Number® and it had become part of lexicon asset selection similar to Morningstar Star Ratings and Lipper Peer Ratings. 

Evolution in wealth management is paramount and as I began to explore the evolution of Riskalyze I was impressed by how they had moved on from just providing a risk score to a diversified set of solutions. To continue their evolution I would make the following recommendations:

Name Change
While the diversification of products is impressive, it has left Riskalyze with a problem: their name. Riskalyze made a splash in the industry with Risk Number® but now they are selling trading and automated asset management where the goal is to remove or limit risk. Additionally, we believe a way to grow is offering Robo services to retail investors and a name like Riskalyze seems counter to the goal of investors. In fact, according to investment writing expert Susan Weiner, the word risk should be avoided when communicating with clients. 

This new name would be the hub while all of the software and services they provide would be spokes. There would be no real FinTech technology needed to implement this change. 

Retail
The democratization of investing has been all the buzz in FinTech especially now during COVID-19. You can’t pick up a periodical or research report without hearing about the impact of the retail or Robinhood trader. In general, this new cohort of investors has taken on amounts of risk they might not be comfortable with if/when we face downside volatility. The regulators are not blind to this. In fact, the state of Massachusetts is one of the first to go after Robinhood for gamification, and on December 17, 2020, the SEC fined them $65M. 

This is just the beginning and Riskalyze is uniquely qualified to help with their Compliance Analytic tools. I don’t anticipate growth in retail self-directed investing slowing but if/when retail investors are required to ride out a significant bear market it may cause migration to the platforms that use risk tolerance instruments. Imagine opening your Robinhood account and seeing you have 95% Risk Number® in a down market. The addition of lower-risk investments would lower that number. Riskalyze has gamified risk, it’s time for the gamified retail self-directed platforms to adopt their tools. 

From a technological standpoint, this would require opening or selling access to its existing Risk Number® data API. Additionally, a client facing website or app could be developed to gather data and provide risk advice. 

Holistic Advice 
Survey participants younger than 40 were four times likelier than advisors over 55 to believe that holistic financial planning was the main value they provided to clients. This new cohort is looking for more than just retirement savings advice. This is an opportunity for the advisor community and Riskalyze. Risk tolerance for investing was the first step, followed by portfolio analytics, retirement plan advice, and now Robo advisory. I believe now is the time for Riskalyze to move into Insurance Planning, College Planning, Student Debt Payment, Crisis Management, and Retirement Income Planning.  

Riskalyze was able to use machine learning to add a value of risk to thousands of investments by themselves and as part of a portfolio. They would need to leverage this technology to index all options and provide an output of advice within each planning segment. As an example, when it comes to college planning they would need to build out data on all college funding options, colleges, tuitions, and expected family contributions. They could then use machine learning to explore the data, identify patterns, and provide recommendations.

Managed Portfolio Models & Autopilot 
The explosion of the Robo Advisor over the past 5-10 years is no secret. The growth simply can’t be ignored. Robo-advisors are forecast to become a $1.4T industry this year, jumping by 47% year-on-year. By 2023, assets managed by Robo-advisors are expected to jump to $2.5T in value. This provides a massive growth opportunity for Riskalyze within the financial advisory world as well as retail. This is a crowded space today so my recommendation would be a build-out of AutoPilot with personalization to a customer’s exact Risk Number®. This would be a valuable differentiator in the space. 

Riskalyze already has this technology built for the advisor marketplace. In order to go direct to consumers, they would need a website and app built to house the Robo.
